MultipleView (Android- Kotlin)

Recyclerview multiple view type (Kotlin)

Suppose, we need to populate a single list with different types of data/view. For example, in a single list of survey we have to ask  various questions. Some question contain only text, some of them contain image and some of them contain video. How can we show different views and handle click event differently?
